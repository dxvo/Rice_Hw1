<h1>KickStart Analysis </h1>
<h3>Background</h3>

Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter</br >
, but not every project has found success. Of the over 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, </br >
only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome. 


Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's </br >
initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in </br >
an attempt to discover some trick to finding success. </br >
The main objective of this homework is to organize and to analyze a database of four thousand past Kickstarter projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.
